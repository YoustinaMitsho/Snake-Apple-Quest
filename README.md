Game description:
The game would play similar to the classic snake game, but with a few key differences.First, it's based on a story narrated in the intro and a goal the player seeks during the game. Second, the snake would be able to move around the environment freely, rather than being confined to a single path. Third, the snake would have to fight enemies in order to progress. Fourth, the snake would be able to collect power-ups that would give him special abilities, such as the ability to gain full health, increase speed and increase jump hight.

The game would have a variety of levels (three levels), each with its own unique challenges. In level one, the player has to fight enemies of different strength and with different tools as one enemy would fight with a punch another with pistol, but be aware of the bulltes as one of the enemies can point the pistol wherever the player goes. In level two, there will be a timer and enemies will spawn from the sky to try and kill the player. the player's task is to avoid the enemies. In level three, the player would encounter the queen in a fight, be careful, the queen throws seeds as projectiles to try and kill the player if the player beats the queen he will be rewarded by the Golden apple which he can take back to his family.

The game is accompanied with main menu that shows new game (which has player name), score board, how to play and exit, as well as a pause menu which can pause and resume the game and can also change the sound volume of the background music.

The game would be a challenging and rewarding experience for players of all ages. It would combine the classic gameplay of the snake game with new elements of action and adventure. The game would be visually appealing, with a colorful and detailed mixture of pixel art and modern art styles. The game would also have a catchy soundtrack that would keep players engaged.
